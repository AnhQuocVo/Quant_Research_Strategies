# Quant Research Strategy Portfolio

##  Introduction  
This repository was created to research and validate various **quantitative trading strategies** to answer:  
> "Do these strategies actually generate sustainable profits, or are they just overhyped backtest results?"  

Each folder in this repository represents an independent project containing:  
- Source code (Pine Script, Python, Jupyter Notebook)  
- Backtest results and charts  
- Detailed documentation and conclusions (README inside each folder)

**Main objectives:**  
- I used to practice data analysis, strategy design, and validation. Improve programming and quantitative reasoning skills.  And also build a portfolio to apply for **Quant Researcher / Quant Analyst** positions
